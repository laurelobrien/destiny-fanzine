      <p>Three human beings stood on a high ridge and saw the shape of the future. Saw rain strike a millennia-old desert. Felt the air sweeten with oxygen and warm water and the beginnings of life.</p>

<p>I am sometimes asked if I felt something die. The end of the era of human self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>I don't know how to answer that question. I do know that I was changed. Nobody could experience that kind of wonder and remain unchanged. The decades since have proven that to me.</p>

<p>I knew I'd never fly another mission like that. I recognized the need for a new love. That's why I threw my fresh cognitive skills into understanding the Traveler. How can one entity so quickly and utterly remake an entire world? Fifty years later, I'm conversant in high mathematics, particularly topological thoughts and the slippery irreality of Light. I'm involved in a project to study the Traveler's terraforming actions right now.</p>

<p>But I still enjoy the interviews. I like going back to that mission.</p>

<p>It makes me unspeakably happy to see how well it all turned out. And it makes me happy to remember I was there.</p>

    <div class="column-two">
      <p>Saturn is the 6th planet from the sun and the second-largest in our solar system after Jupiter. It is a <span>gas giant</span> whose average radius is about nine times that of Earth. It is named for the ancient Roman god of agriculture, father to Jupiter and consort to Lua, and Saturn’s astronomical symbol is derived from his sickle.</p>
      <p>Saturn’s core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of <span>liquid hydrogen and liquid helium</span>, and finally a gaseous outer layer.</p>
      <p>Saturn has a prominent ring system that consists of <span>nine</span> continuous main rings that is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. Sixty-two moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which <span>fifty-three</span> are officially named. Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Its Roman namesake is the god of agriculture who oversaw the <span>Golden Age</span>, where Hesiod and Ovid described humans enjoying the bounty of the earth without farming or labouring.</p>
      <p>He arrived in Italy <span>“de-throned and fugitive”</span>, but brought agriculture and prosperity. His consort Lua, “Mother Destruction”, was a foil for his benevolence and the weapons of enemies were burned in her name.</p>

Carved to endure by Aurash —<br>
The high vengeance —</p>
<p>Only Xi Ro’s bait stars let us escape. Only Sathona’s tricks let us reach the coast. But now that we have my ship, I must lead the way. I am the navigator.</p>
<p>We may never see our homes again. Xi Ro seethes with hate and fury for Taox.</p>
<p>But this is my deepest fear —</p>
<p>Our civilization drifts on the Fundament. At the Tungsten Monoliths I learned that thouasands of other species drift with us, coexisting on a vast world sea. And the tides of the Fundament move us all.</p>
<p>The Timid Truth says that we are the smallest, most fragile things alive. The natural prey of the universe. Our <span>foster mother</span> Taox would have us believe that our ancestors came to the Fundament to hide from the <span>hungry void</span>.</p>
<p>My father died afraid. Not of vile Taox or the Helium Drinkers, but of his orrery. He screamed to me —</p>
<p>“Aurash, my first daughter! The moons are different! The laws are bent!”
And he made the sign of a <span>syzygy</span>.</p>
<p>Imagine the <span>fifty-three moons</span> of Fundament <span>lining up in the sky</span>. (It wouldn’t take all fifty-three, of course: just a few massive moons. But this is my deepest fear.) Imagine their gravity pulling on the Fundament sea, lifting it into a swollen bulge…</p>
<p>Imagine that bulge collapsing as the syzygy passed. A wave big enough to swallow civilizations. A God-Wave.</p>
<p>I have to find a way to stop it. Before the God-Wave annihilates my species. If I could only get back into my father’s orrery, I could learn exactly when!</p>

      <h2>Tartarus <span class="trackout" style="font-weight: normal;">/ TITANOMACHY</span></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column-two">
        <p>Tartarus is the place that deities, demi-gods, and monsters are sent to be punished or imprisoned. Like many concepts in Greek mythology, it is understood as both a physical thing or place, and a godly force. It is even deeper inside the Earth than the Underworld governed by Hades, and in some tellings of myth it is Gaia’s womb, wherein her undesirable children are put back inside of her. Along that vein, ancient Orphic texts understood Tartarus as the “unbounded first-existing entity from which the <span>Light</span> and the Cosmos [were] born”.</p>
<p>The most well-known inhabitants of Tartarus are the giants and titans. Ouranos (Uranus, god of The Sky) and Gaia (goddess of The Earth, The Deep) had titan and giant children. Shocked and disgusted by the giants’ ugliness, Ouranos put them back inside Gaia and imprisoned them in Tartarus. The giants themselves were the one-eyed Cyclopes and the <span>hundred-armed Hekatonkheires</span>. Injured and scorned, Gaia incensed her titan children to usurp Ouranos and free their siblings. The titan Cronus took charge and laid an ambush, capturing Ouranos on his nightly descent to embrace Gaia. The giants were freed while he was pinned, and Ouranos was castrated before being overthrown. Curiously, after taking power, Cronus re-imprisoned the giants in Tartarus.</p>
<p>Ouranos prophesized that Cronus would be overthrown in turn by one of his own children. Cronus consumed every single one of his offspring as a preventative measure but the titan Rhea, his consort and mother to most of his children, managed to save one child. She fed Cronus a blanket-wrapped stone in place of the baby she had smuggled away to a <span>foster mother</span>.</p>
<p>This child grew up to be Zeus, and Gaia saw another chance to free her imprisoned children. She encouraged Zeus to break them out of Tartarus and recruit them as powerful allies with which to defeat Cronus, fulfilling Ouranos’s prophecy. Zeus had to defeat the <span>she-dragon</span> stationed as Tartarus’s guard, Kampe, and together he and the giants waged war on the titans, an event known as the <span><i>Titanomachy</i></span>. They were successful; Zeus’s siblings were freed from Cronus’s belly and the titans were imprisoned in Tartarus.</p>

          <p>For life, Sathona dove. For vengeance, Xi Ro dove. And Aurash dove to understand.</p>
<p>The needle ship pierced the skin of the world and burrowed deep. Through layers of foam and metal and cold elemental slush. Aurash devoured the ship’s maps of Fundament, from the high angelic cloud decks, down and down through storms and oceans and plates of floating world, into the crush of the core.</p>
<p>They met monsters of continental scope. Vast anemones that raised glowing tentacles to bait them in. Xi Ro flew the needle ship through them and they bled black carbon jelly and frost.</p>
<p>They came to a still place, beneath a plate of metal.</p>
<p>“I’ll use the sensors,” whispered Aurash. “Listen...”</p>
<p>In the wet gold dark of the helm, they listened to the ship, and the ship listened to the crushing motions of Fundament.</p>
<p>They heard the collision of continents. They heard the patter and the crash of helium-neon rain. They heard the struggles of monsters. And they heard the distant groan of the ocean rising. Tugged by distant moons.
“The <span>syzygy</span> is real...” Sathona hissed. “It’s already begun.”</p>
<p>Behind them, Xi Ro thought of the birthing-room, where ancient explorers had labored over surgeries and administrations, peeling back the chrysalis and the caul of that which they had made from the deep, whose birth none of them would survive...</p>
<p>“There’s something down here,” she whispered. “Something secret.”</p>
<p>And the Leviathan loomed over them, its brow as huge all the continents of their childhood, its great array-fins crackling with the lightning of its life. Booming into the hull of the needle ship in a microwave voice:</p>

        <p>In common Buddhist belief, the malevolent god Mara has <span>three daughters</span>, whom he either sent to tempt Gautama Buddha or went of their own accord, depending on the telling. They were <i>Tanhā</i> (Craving), <i>Raga</i> (Attachment), and <i>Arati</i> (Aversion). They represent both physical and metaphorical entities, being beautiful women as well as the Three Poisons that frustrate enlightenment.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="four-col">
        <p>Tanhā represents the black hole of need that an unhappy individual will always being trying to fill. She is the unquenchable thirst for physical pleasures such as sex and wealth, as well as ideological pleasures such as adhereing to opinions and beliefs for no other reason than to be a part of something.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="four-col">
        <p>Raga represents <span>attachment and greed</span>, a poison similar to craving that manifests as soon as a craving is satisfied. She encourages individuals to hold onto their attachments to the grave, and takes pleasure in attachments that lead to <span>bondage and servitude in an effort to maintain them</span>. Raga is a sticky trap that will only entrench you further as you struggle to preserve your attachments in an impermanent reality.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="four-col">
        <p>Arati represents aversion, the flip-side of Raga’s attachments. Arati is the desire to <span>erase</span> or avoid that which would sever an individual’s attachments or cause them pain. She <span>exaggerates the negative qualities</span> of anything that threatens a person’s sense of permanence. With each attachment comes an equal and opposite fear of that which would break the attachment.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="row column-two">
      <p>In Buddhism, Mara is acknowledged as both a physical and metaphorical entity just as his daughters are. He has domain over the inferior realms of <i>Kāmadhātu</i>, where he can influence the beings born into an ‘unhappy’ rebirth such as <span>Asura</span>, Preta, and animals. Mara is infamous for tempting Gautama Buddha in an effort to prevent his englightenment and keep him trapped in the <span>endless cycle of death and rebirth</span>.<p>
<p>Mara’s name comes from the Proto-Indo-European root <i>mer</i>, meaning “to die”. As a verbal noun his name means <span>“causing death” or “killing”</span>. While there are some parallels between Mara’s role and the roles of death gods such as Thanatos or the Grim Reaper, Mara is better known for <span>perpetuating death</span> by distracting souls from enlightenment with lust, desire, pride, and other passions.</p>
<p><i>-sov</i>: Greek derivative suffix</p>
<p>1. “openly” or “near at hand”.</p>
<p>2. “from a place” or “under”.</p>
<p>3. indicating the manner of an action: <i>kiv'ri'sov</i> would mean “like a dog”.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="row column-two">
      <p>In Buddhism, Asura are the lowest-ranking of the demigods residing in Kāmadhātu. The word is sometimes translated to “titan” or “anti-god” and has links to the name of the hundred-armed giants in Greek myth, <span>Hekatonkheires</span>. Asura have three faces, four to six arms, and are characterized by their addiction to passions such as lust, pride, falseness, hubris, and envy — particularly envy for the <span>devas</span>, beings slightly above Asura in status.</p>
<p>Asura are mostly harmless besides those residing in the realms <span>influenced by Mara</span>, whose corruption makes Asura combative and malevolent.</p>
<p>Asura are <span>tribal</span> deities and their faction leaders are called Asurendes <span>(“Asura-lord”)</span>.</p>
<p>One of the most well-known Asurendes was <span>Vemacitrin</span>, who lead the charge up the mountain Sumeru. The Asura used to live at Sumeru’s peak, and when Sakra became its new ruler, the Asura celebrated heartily with forbidden wine. Sakra punished them by throwing them over the side of the mountain, and the Asura were unable to resist in their drunken state.  When they awoke, they found the Cittapātali tree blossoming at the mountain’s base had different flowers from the Pāricchattaka tree of their home, and knew they had been <span>dispossessed</span>.</p>
<p>Vemacitrin gathered the Asura to make war on Sumeru’s peak, but they were ultimately tricked into surrender by a <span>bluff</span> Sakra made.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="column-two">
      <p>This happens long ago, but not too long to matter.</p>
<p>Ceres rules the Asteroid Belt. Ceres is the white queen of this space, four hundred million kilometers from the Sun. Ceres is round. Round means power, out here: nothing else in the Belt is big enough to crush itself into a sphere with its own gravity. Ceres has its own chemical stars. Shavings of salt and ice that glint in orbit. Like a crown.</p>
<p>There are other lights, newer stars, newer crowns. Warship engines. Another queen is coming to conquer Ceres, because Ceres is full of warrens and shipyards and habitats, because Ceres is round and lucky as a Servitor. Because Ceres is full of the <span>Wolves she wants to rule</span>.</p>
<p>Shark-fierce ships gather in squadrons and <span>tribes</span>. Skiffs. Ketches. The <span>Kell</span> of Wolves has a fleet gathered here. The Kell of Wolves heard the call, and summoned the House of Wolves to prepare for the great battle on Earth. The salvation of the Kell’s people depends on their ability to shatter the City. It’s a matter of survival.</p>
<p>Now the Wolf fleet turns to meet the Queen.</p>
<p>See the squadrons of Skiffs wrapping themselves in stealth, cold and transparent, knifing out invisible and brave? See the Ketches like broad blades, the bright thoughts of a Servitor guiding them to battle? See them turning, accelerating, waking up their jammers and their arc guns? All doomed. The Kell of Wolves will never make it to the Twilight Gap. The Kell of Wolves put all that strength in one place, and now the Queen of the Reef is coming to break it.</p>
<p>Out there, coming out of the dark, are the Awoken. Not so great a fleet, is it? Little fighters scattered around like four-pointed thorns. Destroyers and frigates and salvaged hulls pulled out of the Reef. And right at the front, at the speartip, flies the Queen.</p>
<p>The Wolf Kell, practical, brave, tallies strength of metal and equipment. The Kell considers the chance that the Awoken have some secret weapon, something gleaned from hulks in the Reef or whispered up by the witches, and sets that chance aside. The Kell thinks the House of Wolves can win decisively. So the Kell sends challenge and warning. <span class="trackout">I AM LORD OF WOLVES</span>, the Kell sends. <span class="trackout">YOU ARE AN EMPTY THING WITH TWO DEAD SOULS. THIS IS MY HOUSE. THESE ARE MY TERMS. SURRENDER AND I WILL ONLY TAKE YOUR SHIPS.</span></p>
<p>The Awoken fleet cuts their engines. Drifts. Wolf strike elements, torpedo-armed Skiffs hidden under jamming and camouflage, find their firing solutions.</p>
<p>The Queen’s ship broadcasts. <span class="trackout">I AM NOBLE TOO</span>, she says, <span class="trackout">OH LORD OF WOLVES</span>.</p>
<p>The Kell doesn’t mind a little banter before the kill. It gives the Wolf ships longer to draw the battle away from Ceres. The Kell replies. <span class="trackout">YOU HAVE NO LINE. YOU HAVE NO POWER.</span> Captains and Barons signal their readiness, Skolas and Pirsis and Irxis, Drevis, Peekis, Parixas, all of them bound by fear and loyalty, all ready for war.</p>
<p><span class="trackout">STARLIGHT WAS MY MOTHER</span>. The Queen’s ship whispers in eerie erratic radio bursts. Servitors begin to report a strange taste in the void. AND <span class="trackout">MY FATHER WAS THE DARK</span><span></span>.</p>
<p>Here, at last, too late, the Kell begins to feel fear. <span class="trackout">CALL ON THEM, THEN</span>, the Kell sends, one last mocking signal before death and ruin, <span class="trackout">AND SEE WHAT HELP THEY OFFER</span>.</p>
<p>So the Queen calls, as only she can. Every Servitor in every Ketch hears it. Every Captain and Baron roars at their underlings as sensors go blind, as firing solutions falter, as reactors stutter and power systems hum with induction. Stealth fails. Space warps. The House of Wolves shouts in spikes of war-code, maneuvers wild, fires blind.</p>

<p>We gathered to take that City and save ourselves from extinction, saying to each other, we must be a storm, a Whirlwind, a darkness, for it is said that only pain may be stolen from the dark, and we can let no more be stolen from us.

<p>We were fools, o children of the Whirlwind. We fought each other when we most needed unity. I fought my rivals when I should have fought the Queen. But I remember now, my dregs, my captains, my Kells, each of us is all of us and I remember: we are a people of resilience. I am the Kell of Kells because I want what we have lost. I am the Dreg of Dregs because I remember that a dreg will grow back what is lost to him.</p>
<p>Ask them my name! Ask them with the shock blade and the shrapnel launcher! Ask them with the skiff and the ketch! Ask your masters by what right they master you, you who have been hardened by centuries of flight, you who inherit the Whirlwind! Ask the Queen for her throne!</p>
<p>Ask them our name. Let them answer: you are Skolas, Kell of Kells. You are Fallen no more.</p>

          <p>At the wedding of of Peleus and Thetis, to which she was not invited, Eris tossed into the party the <span>Apple of Discord</span>, a golden apple inscribed “For the fairest”, provoking the goddesses to begin quarreling about the appropriate recipient. The hapless Paris, Prince of Troy, was appointed to select the fairest by Zeus. The goddesses stripped naked to try to win Paris’ decision, and also attempted to bribe him. </p>
          <p>Hera offered political power.</p>
          <p>Athena promised infinite wisdom.</p>
          <p>Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world: Helen, wife of Menelaus of Sparta.</p>
