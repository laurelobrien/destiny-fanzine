    <div class="column-two">
      <p>Saturn is the 6th planet from the sun and the second-largest in our solar system after Jupiter. It is a <span>gas giant</span> whose average radius is about nine times that of Earth. It is named for the ancient Roman god of agriculture, father to Jupiter and consort to Lua, and Saturn’s astronomical symbol is derived from his sickle.</p>
      <p>Saturn’s core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of <span>liquid hydrogen and liquid helium</span>, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Saturn has a prominent ring system that consists of <span>nine</span> continuous main rings that is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. Sixty-two moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which <span>fifty-three</span> are officially named. Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Its Roman namesake is the god of agriculture who oversaw the <span>Golden Age</span>, where Hesiod and Ovid described humans enjoying the bounty of the earth without farming or labouring.</p>
      <p>He arrived in Italy “de-throned and fugitive”, but brought agriculture and prosperity. His consort Lua, “Mother Destruction”, was a foil for his benevolence and the weapons of enemies were burned in her name.</p>
      <p>Saturn is largely based on and incorporates aspects of the Greek titan Cronus, or Kronos, husband to the titan Rhea and father to Zeus. Cronus and his siblings ambushed and Castrated their father Uranus, the sky, as he was embracing their mother Gaia, the earth. Uranus had banished their terrible Cyclopes and Hekatonkheires children to Tartarus, a prison deep inside the earth, and an enraged Gaia encouraged Cronus’s attack as revenge.</p>
      <p>Though triumphant, Cronus receieved a warning from Uranus that one of his own children would depose him as he had done to his own father, and so Cronus made sure to eat all his children before they could. The titan Rhea, his wife and mother to most of his children, tricked Cronus and hid one of their children with a <span>foster mother</span>.</p>
      <p>When he came of age, the child Zeus freed again the <span>monsters locked in Tartarus</span>, who helped him overthrow Cronus and free his siblings.</p>

      <h2>Mara</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="row column-two">
      <p>In Buddhism, Mara is acknowledged as both a physical and metaphorical entity. He has domain over the inferior realms of Kāmadhātu, where he can influence the beings born into an ‘unhappy’ rebirth such as <span class="POI">Asura<span>, Preta, and animals. Mara is infamous for tempting Gautama Buddha in an effort to prevent his englightenment and keep him trapped in the <span class="POI"><span data-tooltip='Guardians (players) and Ascendant Hive are the only known creatures who are reborn into their previous selves over and over.'>endless cycle of death and rebirth</span></span>.<p>
<p>Mara’s name comes from the Proto-Indo-European root <i>mer</i>, meaning “to die”. As a verbal noun his name means <span>“causing death” or “killing”</span>. While there are some parallels between Mara’s role and gods of death such as Thanatos or the Grim Reaper, Mara is better known for perpetuating death by distracting souls with lust, desire, pride, and other passions.</p>
<p><i>-sov</i>: Greek derivative suffix</p>
<p>1. “openly” or “near at hand”, indicating the manner of an action</p>
<p>2. “from a place” or “under”</p>

          <p>At the wedding of of Peleus and Thetis, to which she was not invited, Eris tossed into the party the <span>Apple of Discord</span>, a golden apple inscribed “For the fairest”, provoking the goddesses to begin quarreling about the appropriate recipient.

          <p>For life, Sathona dove. For vengeance, Xi Ro dove. And Aurash dove to understand.</p>
<p>The needle ship pierced the skin of the world and burrowed deep. Through layers of foam and metal and cold elemental slush. Aurash devoured the ship’s maps of Fundament, from the high angelic cloud decks, down and down through storms and oceans and plates of floating world, into the crush of the core.</p>
<p>They met monsters of continental scope. Vast anemones that raised glowing tentacles to bait them in. Xi Ro flew the needle ship through them and they bled black carbon jelly and frost.</p>
<p>They came to a still place, beneath a plate of metal.</p>
<p>“I’ll use the sensors,” whispered Aurash. “Listen...”</p>
<p>In the wet gold dark of the helm, they listened to the ship, and the ship listened to the crushing motions of Fundament.</p>
<p>They heard the collision of continents. They heard the patter and the crash of helium-neon rain. They heard the struggles of monsters. And they heard the distant groan of the ocean rising. Tugged by distant moons.
“The <span>syzygy</span> is real...” Sathona hissed. “It’s already begun.”</p>
<p>Behind them, Xi Ro thought of the birthing-room, where ancient explorers had labored over surgeries and administrations, peeling back the chrysalis and the caul of that which they had made from the deep, whose birth none of them would survive...</p>
<p>“There’s something down here,” she whispered. “Something secret.”</p>
<p>And the Leviathan loomed over them, its brow as huge all the continents of their childhood, its great array-fins crackling with the lightning of its life. Booming into the hull of the needle ship in a microwave voice:</p>

Carved to endure by Aurash —<br>
The high vengeance —</p>
<p>Only Xi Ro’s bait stars let us escape. Only Sathona’s tricks let us reach the coast. But now that we have my ship, I must lead the way. I am the navigator.</p>
<p>We may never see our homes again. Xi Ro seethes with hate and fury for Taox.</p>
<p>But this is my deepest fear —</p>
<p>Our civilization drifts on the Fundament. At the Tungsten Monoliths I learned that thouasands of other species drift with us, coexisting on a vast world sea. And the tides of the Fundament move us all.</p>
<p>The Timid Truth says that we are the smallest, most fragile things alive. The natural prey of the universe. Taox would have us believe that our ancestors came to the Fundament to hide from the hungry <span>void</span>.</p>
<p>My father died afraid. Not of vile Taox or the Helium Drinkers, but of his orrery. He screamed to me —</p>
<p>“Aurash, my first daughter! The moons are different! The laws are bent!”
And he made the sign of a <span>syzygy</span>.</p>
<p>Imagine the fifty-two moons of Fundament <span>lining up in the sky</span>. (It wouldn’t take all fifty-two, of course: just a few massive moons. But this is my deepest fear.) Imagine their gravity pulling on the Fundament sea, lifting it into a swollen bulge…</p>
<p>Imagine that bulge collapsing as the syzygy passed. A wave big enough to swallow civilizations. A God-Wave.</p>
<p>I have to find a way to stop it. Before the God-Wave annihilates my species. If I could only get back into my father’s orrery, I could learn exactly when!</p>
<p>We are weeks of travel and many continents away from home.</p>

      <h2>Asura</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="row column-two">
      <p>In Buddhism, Asura are the lowest-ranking of the demigods residing in Kāmadhātu. The word is sometimes translated to “titan” or “anti-god” and has links to the name of the hundred-armed giants in Greek myth, Hekatonkheires. Asura have three faces, four to six arms, and are characterized by their addiction to passions such as lust, pride, falseness, hubris, and envy — particularly for the devas, beings slightly above Asura in status.</p>
<p>Asura are mostly harmless besides those residing in the realms <span>influenced by Mara</span>, whose corruption makes Asura combative and malevolent.</p>
<p>Asura are <span>tribal</span> deities and their faction leaders are called Asurendes <span>(“Asura-lord”)</span>.</p>
<p>One of the most well-known Asurendes was <span class="POI"><span data-tooltip="See: Skolas">Vemacitrin</span></span>, who lead the charge up the mountain Sumeru. The Asura used to live at Sumeru’s peak, and when Sakra became its new ruler, the Asura celebrated heartily with forbidden wine. Sakra punished them by throwing them over the side of the mountain, and the Asura were unable to resist in their drunken state.  When they awoke, they found the Cittapātali tree blossoming at the mountain’s base had different flowers from the Pāricchattaka tree of their home, and knew they had been <span>dispossessed</span>.</p>
<p>Vemacitrin gathered the Asura to make war on Sumeru’s peak, but they were ultimately tricked into surrender by a bluff Sakra made.</p>
