    <h2 class="page-title">Saturn</h2>
    <div class="column-two">
      <p>Saturn is the 6th planet from the sun and the second-largest in our solar system after Jupiter. It is a gas giant whose average radius is about nine times that of Earth. It is named for the ancient Roman god of agriculture, father to Jupiter and consort to Lua, and Saturn’s astronomical symbol is derived from his sickle.</p>
      <p>Saturn’s core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Saturn has a prominent ring system that consists of nine continuous main rings that is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. Sixty-two moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which fifty-three are officially named. Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.
      Its Roman namesake is the god of agriculture who oversaw the Golden Age, where Hesiod and Ovid described humans enjoying the bounty of the earth without farming or labouring.</p>
      <p>He arrived in Italy “de-throned and fugitive”, but brought agriculture and prosperity. His consort Lua, “Mother Destruction”, was a foil for his benevolence and the weapons of enemies were burned in her name.</p>
      <p>Saturn is largely based on and incorporates aspects of the Greek titan Cronus, or Kronos, husband to the titan Rhea and father to Zeus. Cronus and his siblings ambushed and Castrated their father Uranus, the sky, as he was embracing their mother Gaia, the earth. Uranus had banished their terrible Cyclopes and Hekatos children to Tartarus, a prison deep inside the earth, and an enraged Gaia encouraged Cronus’s attack as revenge.</p>
      <p>Though triumphant, Cronus receieved a warning from Uranus that one of his own children would depose him as he had done to his own father, and so Cronus made sure to eat all his children before they could. The titan Rhea, his wife mother to most of his children, tricked Cronus and hid one of their children with a foster mother.</p>
      <p>When he came of age, the child Zeus freed again the monsters locked in Tartarus, who helped him overthrow Cronus and free his siblings.</p>

      <h2>Mara</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="row column-two">
      <p>In Buddhism, Mara is acknowledged as both a physical and metaphorical entity. He has domain over the inferior realms of Kāmadhātu, where he can influence the beings born into an ‘unhappy’ rebirth such as Asura, Preta, and animals. Mara is infamous for tempting Gautama Buddha in an effort to prevent his englightenment and keep him trapped in the endless cycle of death and rebirth.<p>
<p>Mara’s name comes from the Proto-Indo-European root <i>mer</i>, meaning “to die”. As a verbal noun his name means “causing death” or “killing”. While there are some parallels between Mara’s role and gods of death such as Thanatos or the Grim Reaper, Mara is better known for perpetuating death by distracting souls with lust, desire, pride, and other passions.</p>
<p><i>-sov</i>: Greek derivative suffix</p>
<p>1. “openly” or “near at hand”, indicating the manner of an action</p>
<p>2. “from a place” or “under”</p>
