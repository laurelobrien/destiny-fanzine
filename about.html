      <h3 class="trackout">The Traveler</h3>
      <p>The Traveler is a titanic sphere that visited our solar system, terraforming planets like Mars and Venus for our inhabitation. Three astronauts went to meet it on Mars, and it communicated its benevolence to them and the entire human race. The mysterious entity proceeded to bless humankind with centuries of peace and rest, known as the Golden Age. This age of plenty ended when several alien races appeared in our system at once, forces of ‘Darkness’ chasing the Traveler’s ‘Light’, a loaded set of terms that is never explained to the player beyond their immediate allegiance to one side.</p>

      <h3 class="trackout">Ghosts</h3>
      <p>Ghosts are small children of the Traveler, released when it entered a coma-like slumber to defend itself. Ghosts themselves have very little power, but they can empower other beings and, once bonded to that being, resurrect them from the dead endlessly.</p>

<h3 class="trackout">Guardians</h3>
<p>Players assume the role of a Guardian, someone resurrected by a Ghost. They are chosen by their ghost for being great warriors, intellectuals, or protectors of the people in their first life. They are not alive in the original sense, and yet they cannot die as long as their Ghost is present to resurrect them.</p>

<h3 class="trackout">The Fallen</h3>
<p>The Fallen are a four-armed race with a biological caste system. They breathe Ether, a substance manufactured by their machine gods — greater concentrations of Ether allow Fallen to grow physically and intellectually. Dregs are Fallen that have had their lower arms docked, and are allowed to regrow them and consume more Ether when they have proved themselves worthy, at which point they ascend to a Vandal. Likewise, Vandals who honour themselves are promoted to Captains, and at each stage of this strange merit-based life cycle, Ether consumption is allowed to increase. Their leaders are captains with the largest supply of Ether, termed a Kell, and a Kell will rule a “House” (a form of faction or tribe) until they die or are overthrown. The Fallen we see represent a diaspora from their ruined home planet, seeking the Traveler that abandoned them.</p>

<h3 class="trackout">The Hive</h3>
<p>The Hive are an ancient insect-like race, older than our sun. They originated as “krill people” on a far-away gas giant named The Fundament, timid weak things with short lifespans. Three sisters, heirs to their monarchy and betrayed by their foster mother, sought a solution to their race’s short, horrifying lives. Deep inside their planet they found the Worm Gods, smooth-talking parasites who gave them eternal life and paracausal powers in exchange for hosting their larvae. The Hive traverse galaxies eliminating every living thing in their path, seeking to carve the universe into its perfect shape — without waste, without the lie of a gentle life, without the illusion of kindness and comfort that is ripped away before death.</p>

<p>Mara Sov is the Queen of the Reef, a network of Awoken colonies closer to Saturn than Earth. Awoken are humans that were mysteriously affected by a deep-space phenomenon, from which humans on Earth were shielded by the Traveler.</p>

  <p><i>Destiny</i> is a video game available on Xbox One, Xbox 360, Playstation 4, and Playstation 3. It was developed by Bungie, the studio responsible for creating the famous first-person shooter <i>Halo</i> franchise, who worked on it from 2000 to 2010, at which point they became independent, frustrated by their contract with Microsoft who had purchased the Halo franchise.</p>

  <p>Destiny had an incredible aura of anticipation and greatness as the advertised "life's work" of Bungie, who was finally empowered to make the game they had always talked about, a game which was constrained by contracts and funding and technology and half-surfaced as Halo. It was marketed as a <span class="trackout">MMOFPSRPG</span>, an intentionally overwhelming acronym for "massively multiplayer online first-person shooter role-playing game". It was the first of its kind to blend science-fiction shooters with the fluid story-telling abilities of an RPG, allowing the player to flit from planet to planet in a post-apocalyptic future.</p>

  <p> If video games aren't a medium you're familiar with, a good parallel is cinematography and the film industry. Art and commercialism are often in contention, and “Triple-A” games seek the widest audience possible to cover astronomical production costs, much like Hollywood blockbusters. Plots and characters may be entertaining but rarely strike deep or challenge the viewer. It is with this expectation that a Triple-A release like Destiny was received, whose budget was more than double that of James Cameron’s Avatar at $500 million USD. Gamers were incredibly excited but enthusiasm for the story elements was appropriately tempered.

<p>Imagine the collective surprise when not only did Destiny not have a ground-breaking, soul-touching story but it had almost no story at all:</p>

[google search here]

<p>Even for a mainstream video game, the plot was threadbare or absent entirely. Enemy combatants were engaged without explanation. Players were dropped into massive fantasy worlds with lush ecosystems and alien landscapes only to be sped right through it to a checkpoint. The NPCs (non-player characters) exchanged such dire dialogue as “An evil so dark it hates other evil…” and famously “I don’t even have time to explain why I don’t have time to explain.”</p>

<p>However, beneath the 500 million dollars of particle effects and simulated violence was a dense, complex story. It just wasn’t accessible in-game. Players unlock grimoire cards throughout their adventures, and are notified by a pop-up on their TV to visit a website to view it. The oddity of engaging with a video game outside of its console still puts most players off of it, and many have reported they don’t even notice the pop-up anymore; it’s conditioned out of their vision like a banner advertisement on a website.</p>

<p>The grimoire cards act as disjointed records and short stories, with a word count of over 60,000 — about the average length of a novel. They are cryptic, bizarrely-written, and don’t seem concerned with being read by a general audience at all. Entire cards will be written in pseudo-code or taken from an alien transcript with no context at all. Flat, two-dimensional characters are suddenly allegories for Greek myth or provide puzzles for players that require advanced music education. One mystery could not be solved until a player with a major in Philosophy and a minor in Classical Studies took a crack at it and shared his findings. There is game content entirely inaccessible to players without solving these riddles, which is an intriguing disregard for mainstream, Triple-A production.</p>

<p>This volume of research materials has been compiled to document and guide readers through the strange, aloof non-story in Bungie's sci-fi shooter <i>Destiny</i>.</p>
